In this example, we asked ChatGPT to identify the problem in a specific GitLab job and provide a detailed explanation of what went wrong and how it can be fixed. 

The prompt used was:

> "Can you identify the problem in the job link [job link] and provide a detailed explanation of what went wrong and how it can be fixed?"

The conversation screenshots below show how ChatGPT interacted with the GitAIOps plugin to fetch the job logs and analyze the error.
